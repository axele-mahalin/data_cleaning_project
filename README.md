Week 3 - Data Cleaning

88 rows

Years will need to be cleaned (eg. 2018-2019, 2018-19)
Choose a time period relevant for our analysis, or the one that has the more data

Total to drop since we don't know its the total of hat

We have null values we'll need to get rid off

We may need to remove Tunisia etc. (line 78 to 82) since there is not data for these countries

We will not use the sub-region (too detailed)

We're gonna check if there is a correlation between the wealth quintile indicators and the rural versus urban residence, in other words, if for example developing countries are more incline to be rural than urban

We're gonna group by Income Group

Drop outliers values

We may use the corrwith in order to do the correlation between the serie Total and the 4 indicators

Analysis :

For 2010, we only had data for South Soudan and Burkina Faso
